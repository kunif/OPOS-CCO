## Installation  
Please install according to the following procedure.  


- Create an appropriate folder (as below) for the target and copy the files.  
  - File copy source  
    - OPOS 32bit: \*.dll and \*.ocx in the OCX\\Win32\\Release folder  
    - OPOS 64bit: \*.dll and \*.ocx in the OCX\\x64\\Release folder  
  - OPOS 32bit copy destination  
    - 64bit OS: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OPOS\\CommonCO115 folder  
    - 32bit OS: C:\\Program Files\\OPOS\\CommonCO115 folder  
  - OPOS 64bit files copy destination  
    - 64bit OS: C:\\Program Files\\OPOS\\CommonCO115 folder  


- Run RegSvr32.exe as an administrator and register the DLL as a registry.  
  - Prior processing at 64bit OS: Run C:\\Windows\\SysWOW64\\cmd.exe as administrator.  
  - Move to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\OPOS\\CommonCO115 folder.  
  - Run "For %I in (\*.dll,\*.ocx) do RegSvr32 /s %I".  
  - 32bit/64bit Both operating systems: Run C:\\Windows\\System32\\cmd.exe as administrator.  
  - Move to C:\\Program Files\\OPOS\\CommonCO115 folder.  
  - Run "For %I in (\*.dll,\*.ocx) do RegSvr32 /s %I".  
  - Check displayed both execution normally and close cmd.exe.  


## Known Issues  
The following issues are known.  

- It is better to be able to cooperate and synchronize with OPOS for .NET Assemblies, but I do not do anything related to it.  
- The interface definition dll for OPOS ServiceObject may have compatibility problems if there is an interface addition in the next 1.16 version etc. It may not be included in the official version.  
- Installer is not created.  
- Since there is no way to include the definition name of OPOS device definition registry key name or device statistics item name in the DLL, only C# source is created.  
- OPOS device definition registry exists independently in 32bit/64bit environment, and there is no way to cooperate with them or handle them  collectively.
